# ðŸš€ Planetary Classifier 
A cutting-edge Machine Learning project that classifies planets based on key features like atmosphere, gravity, and surface temperature â€” unlocking the secrets of the cosmos with data.
âœ¨ Predict. Explore. Discover.

#     Project Overview
This project builds a Random Forest model to classify planets based on multiple features collected from real and simulated datasets. The goal is to make accurate predictions that can help in studying planets automatically.

#     Key Features
	â€¢	Detailed Dataset â€“ Includes planetary attributes such as atmospheric density, surface temperature, mineral abundance, gravity, and radiation levels.
	â€¢	Data Cleaning & Preparation â€“ Missing values carefully handled, features scaled, and categorical data encoded for better model input.
	â€¢	Model Choice â€“ Random Forest Classifier selected for its reliability and strong performance on complex datasets.
	â€¢	Evaluation Metrics â€“ Model performance assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
	â€¢	Feature Importance â€“ Clear visualizations highlight which features most influence the predictions.
